Vector databases and their uses are transforming how we work. They are fundamentally changing how data is stored, managed, and retrieved through their deep integration with AI models. In this course, learn practical, end-to-end skills on how to build and use vector databases. Instructor Joon-Pil Hwang guides you through building an application that is primarily powered by a vector database, taking you all the way from database creation to usage and even app integration. Learn key considerations in using a vector database in practice, as well as be aware of some common techniques and baseline choices as starting points. Discover keyword, vector, and hybrid searches to find the right data faster, as well as how to apply retrieval-augmented generation - which makes generative AI tools more accurate by grounding them with your data.

## Instructions
You will be using Python scripts with `.py` extensions for this course. Each script is named to correspond to a video - such as `02_04_import.py` for video `02_04`.

## Installation
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- Python 3 (3.10 or newer recommended)
    - Python libraries:
