## Instructions
You will be using Python scripts with `.py` extensions for this course. Each script is named to correspond to a video - such as `02_04_import.py` for video `02_04`.

## Installation
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- Python 3 (3.10 or newer recommended)
    - Python libraries:
        - Weaviate Python client (Latest available version recommended, developed with 4.4.3)
        - Pandas (Developed with 2.1.4)
        - Streamlit (Developed with 1.29.0)
        - MediaWikiAPI (Developed with 1.2.0)
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. You will need your own Weaviate database instance. Section 2.01 will show you how to do so.
    - As an alternative, you can run Weaviate any way you prefer, such as through Docker or Kubernetes. Please see the [official documentation](https://www.weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation) for more details.
